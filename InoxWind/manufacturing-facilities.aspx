                                In Gujarat, IWL has established state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in both Bhuj and Ahmedabad. The Bhuj facility is known for its adherence to the highest standards and production of top-quality nacelles and hubs. Meanwhile, the Ahmedabad facility, slated to commence operations by December 2024, will further bolster our manufacturing capabilities. Our products undergo multiple quality checks at various stages of manufacturing to ensure a diverse range of high-quality offerings. By combining our partnership with AMC, DHHI, and Elin, we have enhanced our capabilities for the smooth manufacturing of 3 MW wind turbine generators in Gujarat.
